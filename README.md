# Javascript-Capstone 🎥

Javascript-Capstone project is a web application that we created using our knowledge on HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The project focuses on TV shows, which relies on an external API for data retrieval. It retrieves information from the API and presents a list of TV shows, accompanied by features for liking and commenting on them.
